# Autonav Final Task
## Clone this repository in the right subdirectory of your ros2 workspace, you might need to look into how exactly you clone, or some files might not work
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo.git```bash

### After you have cloned the repo in the right place, build only the ``autonav`` package. Or you can try building all and see for yourself. And once the autonav package is built, run the following:
```bash
ros2 autonav launch robot.launch.py
#### You might get some errors, but then you're on your own
